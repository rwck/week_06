# Lessons from Project_01

## Time
Things got quicker, but they were really slow in the beginning.
This time I spent a long time planning.

# What did I learn?

## Getting user permissions working is a truly Massive Thing
* I thought I was building an FMEA app with some user permissions in it
* I was actually building a user database with a tiny little function in it that does a calculation based on what you put into a form - at the moment it's not even performing the right calculation.

## Fun
* Very satisfying when things do actually work...

## Hard bits
* Getting my head round the complexity of Rails in the beginning
*
